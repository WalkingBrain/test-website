        <h2>You read it. It's time for Pre-calc.</h2>
        <p>
            I know, I started learning calculus, but found out that I don't know much
            about the basics. "I don't know how to solve a simple equation like 2x + 3 = 5.",
            AI generated. But that's dumb, I know that. I did quadratic equations in 7th grade.
            But I don't know trigonometry. I know a bit of trig identities, but not much.
            And since my teacher offered me Pre-calc textbooks along with the calculus ones,
            I took them. She said that all of that might take me two years, but I reckon
            I can do it in one. I mean, I did calculus in a month, so why not?

            Now that you read this, you deserve a reward.

        <h2>So I'll talk about bikes!</h2>
        <p>
            Sorry if you don't like bikes, but this is what I've been doing recently. And I've
            been trying to do something resembling a manual and a wheelie at the same time.
            Seat down, standing, pedaling. My record's like five seconds, but I'm learning.
            I'm also jumping more and more on the parody of a pump track we have here. It's dirt,
            has horrible flow and is full of loose pebbles, but it's jumpable. When I jump good,
            it's always that I'm alone, and when I jump bad, it's always that I'm with someone.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for other things, my helmet's grown on me. It didn't fit the greatest, but now it does.
            Magic. I want to get new gloves, but I haven't gotten to a bike shop yet. I am not sure
            between Fox Ranger and Fox Flexair. The Rangers are cheaper and more durable, but the Flexairs
            are lighter and more breathable, which is great for summer. But they offer less protection in
            the case that I crash. I don't know, maybe I'll get the Rangers and then the Flexairs later.
            Or vice versa? I don't know.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to get riding some bike parks (but the less gnarly kind) but they're all at least
            an hour and half away. My dad wants to buy a bike rack, meaning flowy bike parks are not too
            far away.

            bike. It has 130mm of travel in the front and 120mm in the back. Here are the specs (geo sometime else):
