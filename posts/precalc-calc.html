        <h2>You read it. It's time for Pre-calc.</h2>
        <p>
            I know, I started learning calculus, but found out that I don't know much
            about the basics. "I don't know how to solve a simple equation like 2x + 3 = 5.",
            AI generated. But that's dumb, I know that. I did quadratic equations in 7th grade.
            But I don't know trigonometry. I know a bit of trig identities, but not much.
            And since my teacher offered me Pre-calc textbooks along with the calculus ones,
            I took them. She said that all of that might take me two years, but I reckon
            I can do it in one. I mean, I did calculus in a month, so why not?

            Now that you read this, you deserve a reward.
