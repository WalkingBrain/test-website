        <p>Welcome to my very first blog post! I might share things here (if I don't get bored)</p>
        
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>It seemed like fun, but it's more of typing than problem solving but I guess it might be useful in the long run</p>

        <h2>This is literally me coding this.</h2>

        <p>I'm bad I know. It's mostly ChatGPT code but I found out that I'm going to need experience with web development so here we are.</p>
        
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>Honestly, if you asked this,take a look at the text and image above.</p>
        <p>And if you somehow aren't capable of that, it's using ChatGPT.</p>
