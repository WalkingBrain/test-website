        <h2>How to measure time?</h2>
        <p>
            This might seem like a weird question, but hear me out. I live in Czechia, which 
            means I'm one hour ahead of Greenwich. My clocks also follow daylight saving time, 
            meaning once a year, I get one hour more sleep, and once a year one hour less. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've intentionally avoided a single acronym so far: UTC. A standard by which time is 
            measured, based on the TAI, temps atomique international (International atomic time). 
            UTC doesn't follow daylight savings time, so during summer, you can confuse people into 
            thinking you're in UTC-1, but in reality you're talking UTC. At the time of writing, 
            it's 12:11 PM local time, but 10:11 AM UTC. So that's how I measure time now.

        <h2>Sheldon, Calculus, And a new bike</h2>
        <p>
            To people who know the show Young Sheldon, this naming has already reminded you of it. 
            That is by no means bad, but neither does it lead to prosperity. In short, I have Netflix 
            now and binge Sheldon whenever I can. It's great, funny and relatable. That is maybe the 
            reason why I didn't upload any videos in the last month.
        </p>

            As your average eighth-grader, I too begun learning the basics of calculus, both integral 
            and differential. If you know one, you basically know the other, so learning went something 
            like this: oh, derivatives of polynomials are simple, there's an exponent rule and some rules 
            to addition. and an integral's the opposite? okay, I'm spending physics class by integrating 
            random polynomials of various powers. I plan on learning more, but for like an hour of 
            learning, isn't that good? And the slope between any two points x1 and x2 on y=x^2 is x1 + x2.

            My dad bought a bike. A full suspension one to be more exact. Even more exact, a Trek Top Fuel 8
            Gen 3. But I ride it.
