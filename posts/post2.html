    <h2>Hello again!</h2>
    <p>I am currently in ICT class, so I can do (nearly) whatever I want as long as it's related to IT and
        it's in some way useful. I plan on making a game and compile it to WASM so I can run it on the web
        so y'all can try it. (is there even anyone looking at this?)
