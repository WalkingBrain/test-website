    <h2>Hello again!</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently in ICT class, so I can do (nearly) whatever I want as long as it's related to IT and
        it's in some way useful. I plan on making a game and compile it to WASM so I can run it on the web
        so y'all can try it (is there even anyone looking at this?). Anyways, I guess today's not the day for that
        but I'll give you something in the meantime:

        It's basically nothing but you know, it's Rust so that's actually great that it only took me about an afternoon of learning.
        I haven't done much else since I was looking at my bike (there might actually be some MTB-related content here soon!) and
        I finally put my new bike lights on there. Am I getting off topic?
    </p>
    <h2>Of course I am not, this is a blog not a wikipedia article</h2>

        I also wanted to install my pedals but I don't have any grease nor a torque wrench (or maybe we do have those at home but I
        didn't want to bother my dad with it) but my mum asked her colleague about it and apparently I'm getting both grease (to keep)
        and a torque wrench (that I'm going to have to return) so it's a win! I'm so excited to go ride my bike, but I can't yet since
        apparently my bike has to go to a bike shop for service and they only service bike from April forward but on their website they 
        they already do, I guess I have to convince my dad to bring it there (it's 20km away, I'd love to just take it there by public
        transport though) but then my dad wouldn't like that. My dad also plans to buy his own bike (a full-sus while I have a Trek
        Procaliber 8 2024 which is a hardtail) but it's been two weeks and he hasn't bought it yet so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. And we've come to the
        end of today's post! I've got to make a template for these so they're not that hard to make so it doesn't take me two weeks of
        doing nothing. Cya!
